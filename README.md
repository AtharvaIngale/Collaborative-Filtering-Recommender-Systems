# Collaborative-Filtering-Recommender-Systems

<h4> The goal of a collaborative filtering recommender system is to generate two vectors: For each user, a 'parameter vector' that embodies the movie tastes of a user. 
  <br/>
  For each movie, a feature vector of the same size which embodies some description of the movie. 
  <br/>
  The dot product of the two vectors plus the bias term should produce an estimate of the rating the user might give to that movie. </h4>
